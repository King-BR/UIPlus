### Compatibility
Should be compatible with all mods, including mods that add more storages, engines, tanks, etc... If any mods cause problems, contact me in the [RaftModding](https://discord.com/invite/juE5uKf8pe) discord server (KingBR#3793)

**Tested with:**
* [More Storages](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/morestorages)
* [Augmented Items](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/augmented-items)
* [Auto Sorter](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/auto-sorter)
* [Augmented Items](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/augmented-items)
* [Mirrored Engines](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/mirrored-engines)
* [Eletricity Mod](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/electricity-mod) **AS THE ENGINE USES ELETRICITY INSTEAD OF FUEL IT WONT SHOW THE CAPACITY**
* [Voyage Overhaul](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/voyage-overhaul)
* [Bigger Plots](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/biggerplots)

### Multiplayer
Others players wont be able to see the storage labels you created, but i'm working on it

### Known bugs
* Trees in cropplots are listed named as "item", I'm trying to find a better way to get the plant name
